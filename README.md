 I used a linear gradient in the **header and footer** of the About Me page:  
  `background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff7e5f, #feb47b);`  
  This creates a smooth horizontal gradient effect.
  I used an angled linear gradient in the **about-container section** of the About Me page:  
  `background: linear-gradient(45deg, #6a11cb, #2575fc);`  
  This creates a diagonal gradient effect from purple to blue.
