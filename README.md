I made this portfolio website for my HTML and CSS assignment. It has four pages: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact Me. The About page has my picture, a short intro, and a video. The Projects page lists four of my projects with short descriptions, and the Contact page has a working form people can fill out.
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses basic HTML5 and CSS3. I didn’t use Flexbox because we’re not allowed to for this assignment. Instead, I used inline-block and percentages to make things fit different screen sizes. I also made three separate CSS files:
For phones (768px and under)
For tablets (769px to 1024px)
For laptops and bigger screens (1025px and up)
Each screen size has its own layout so things don’t look squished or too spread out.
I also added gradients on the About Me page. The header and footer use a left-to-right gradient, and the main section has a diagonal gradient in the background.
